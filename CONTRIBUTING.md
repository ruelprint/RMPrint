This contributors document should be the canonical place for answers to:

    What are some ways I can contribute?
    Where can I file bugs? What makes a good bug report?
    What do I need to do to contribute code? What will make my pull request immediately mergeable?
    What is the code review process?
    What sort of organizational schema is used for Github Issues? What labels are used, and what do they mean? How are milestones handled?
